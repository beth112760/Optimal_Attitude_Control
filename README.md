Description:
This code solves the Optimal Attitude Control problem for the eigenaxis rotation about the yaw axis. The list below gives details on each file

- Low_thrust_orbit_main_Local_constrained_alim70000.m: This is the main file to run. It computes the CRBF-cover scheme solution and exact solution
- lowthrustNAE_local_constrained_7000.m: This is the function file
- rbf0 - Computes phi using a Multiquadric CRBF
- rbf1 - Computes phi_D using a Multiquadric CRBF
